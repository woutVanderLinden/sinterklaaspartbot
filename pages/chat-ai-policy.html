	If you're reading this, you've probably messaged PartProfessor or PartBot. Long story short, I (PartMan) plan on adding a natural text processor to PartBot for easier interactions, and I'm running tests via PartProfessor. You might have some question; so give this a read. If you still have any queries; feel free to mesage me on PS! or on Discord at PartMan#7321.

	<br />
	<b>What do I do to opt in?</b>
	<br />
	Simply continue chatting naturally with the Bot. If there's anything that seems weird, please report it to me.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Are these chats private?</b>
	<br />
	In a way. I retain the right to go through these chat logs (only PMs) for testing purposes, data validation, and to ensure no one's trying to flirt with my Bot. Apart from that, I will not divulge these logs to anyone except global staff in necessary circumstances.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>How do I make a Bot?</b>
	<br />
	Err, probably ask in Bot Development.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Why do you have two Bots?</b>
	<br />
	I can't really run shoddy and untested code on PartBot, can I? Board Games would be sad if it crashed during a game of Chain Reaction.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Why do you stink?</b>
	<br />
	Dunno, been wondering that for a while.
